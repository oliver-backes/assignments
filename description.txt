I took a look at 2017Q1 House spending on carpets, focusing on entries over $1k. It appears that the bulk of spending on carpet (which in this case amounted to around $236k) comes not from members themselves but from the official House of Representatives furnishings department or the Chief Administrative Officer of the House (the max entry was more than half the total at $156k, which I expect did not come from a member). Three members, however, did spend more that $1k on carpet - Steven Palazzo, Barry Loudermilk, and Lloyd Doggett.
